## Issues
I created `throttled-queue` at the behest of myself over 6 years ago at the time of this writing, due to the need for such a library in my own projects.

It does what I need it to do, and hopefully it does for you too.

If you encounter a genuine bug with its intended functionality, feel free to create an issue on Github, but I'm under no obligation to respond to or fix your issue.

## Feature requests
This library is basically a "done" project. The code is minimal, and its functionality is well-defined.

It is highly unlikely that I will add new features unless I have a need for it.

Should you need new features, I encourage you to fork this project. Pull requests with new features will probably not be accepted.
